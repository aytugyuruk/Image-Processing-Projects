# Image Processing Projects

This repository is a curated collection of **image processing and computer vision projects** developed in Python.  
The projects focus primarily on **classical computer vision techniques** and practical, real-world use cases.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate a solid understanding of:
- Image processing fundamentals
- Traditional computer vision pipelines
- Algorithmic thinking applied to visual data

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🔹 Basic Security Camera (Computer Vision)
A simple security camera system that detects motion and changes in video frames using classical image processing techniques.

**Key concepts:**
- Frame differencing
- Background subtraction
- Motion detection
- OpenCV video processing

---

### 🔹 Smart Document Scanner
A document scanning pipeline that automatically detects document boundaries and applies perspective transformation to obtain a clean, scanned version.

**Key concepts:**
- Edge detection
- Contour detection
- Perspective transformation
- Image enhancement

---

### 🔹 Color Counter Algorithm
An algorithm that analyzes images and counts dominant colors or specific color ranges.

**Key concepts:**
- Color spaces (RGB / HSV)
- Color masking
- Pixel-level analysis
- Histogram-based processing

---

### 🔹 PDF Converter with Auto Contrast & Brightness
A tool that processes document images or PDFs by automatically adjusting contrast, brightness, and converting them to grayscale for improved readability.

**Key concepts:**
- Image normalization
- Contrast enhancement
- Grayscale conversion
- PDF and image preprocessing

---

### 🔹 QR Code Scanner
A computer vision application that detects and decodes QR codes from images or live camera input.

**Key concepts:**
- QR code detection
- Image preprocessing
- Classical CV-based object detection
- OpenCV utilities

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- NumPy
- Classical Computer Vision Algorithms

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository represents my **early to mid-stage computer vision work**, focusing on understanding how visual data is processed at a low level before applying deep learning approaches.

It serves as a strong foundation for:
- Advanced computer vision
- Deep learning–based vision models
- Real-time vision systems

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each project is organized in its own folder.
- Projects are independent and can be run separately.
- The focus is on clarity, learning, and practical application rather than heavy optimization.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Performance optimizations
- Better modularization
- Integration with deep learning–based vision pipelines
- Real-time and embedded system extensions
